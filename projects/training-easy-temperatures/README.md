## Rules

Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).

## Game Input

Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.

###Input
Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze

Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526

### Output
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.

### Constraints
0 ≤ N < 10000
